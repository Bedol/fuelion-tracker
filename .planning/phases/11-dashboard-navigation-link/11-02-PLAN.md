<objective>
Verify the restored statistics-to-dashboard navigation path end-to-end.

Purpose: Confirm that the phase closes the flow break with consistent behavior across devices, locales, and auth states.
Output: Human verification result covering desktop/mobile navigation, statistics return actions, and localization.

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Dashboard/home links were added to shared navigation and both statistics pages with EN/PL i18n coverage.</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Run `npm run dev` and sign in.
    2. Desktop check: confirm Dashboard is first nav item and clicking it routes to `/`; click the logo/wordmark and confirm it also routes to `/`.
    3. Mobile viewport check: confirm bottom navigation includes Dashboard tab with standard tab styling and tap routes to `/`.
    4. Visit `/statistics`; confirm a secondary `Go to Dashboard` action is visible in placeholder/empty states and routes to `/`.
    5. Visit `/vehicles/<ownedVehicleId>/statistics`; confirm top action row includes `Go to Dashboard` and routes to `/` in loading/no-data/populated states.
    6. Switch locale to Polish and confirm labels become `Pulpit` and `Przejdź do pulpitu`; switch back to English and confirm `Dashboard` and `Go to Dashboard`.
    7. Sign out and try opening `/statistics` or `/vehicles/<ownedVehicleId>/statistics`; confirm existing auth redirect/sign-in behavior remains intact.
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if all checks pass, or list failing step numbers with observed behavior.</resume-signal>

</tasks>

<verification>
- Manual checks validate statistics -> dashboard flow on desktop/mobile and EN/PL locales.
- Manual checks confirm unauthenticated redirect behavior unchanged.
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- All listed verification steps pass without regressions.
- Stats-to-dashboard path is discoverable and one-tap across all required surfaces.
- Localization and auth behaviors remain consistent with locked phase context.
  </success_criteria>
