<objective>
Create the Phase 2 and Phase 5 verification artifacts required to close DoD blockers.

Purpose: Provide auditable, step-by-step verification of vehicle CRUD + dashboard behavior.
Output: Two Markdown checklists with recorded verification results.

  <action>
Create two Markdown verification artifacts with the following structure:

For `08-VEHICLE-VERIFICATION.md`:

- Header with date, environment, tester, and data setup notes
- A requirements table covering VEHI-01 through VEHI-06 with columns: Status (Pass/Fail), Notes
- A step-by-step checklist covering:
  - Create a basic vehicle (brand, model, year, registration)
  - Create a vehicle with technical data (engine capacity, power, fuel type)
  - List view with fuel type icons
  - Detail view for both vehicles (technical card only when data exists)
  - Edit flow (pre-filled form, save, updated values)
  - Delete flow (confirmation, removal, empty state if last item)

For `08-DASHBOARD-VERIFICATION.md`:

- Header with date, environment, tester, and data setup notes
- A requirements table covering UIUX-02 with Status/Notes
- A step-by-step checklist covering:
  - Summary section renders vehicle cards with totals and last fueling date
  - Recent activity section shows latest fuelings (or empty state when none)
  - Quick Add button opens fueling form for the selected vehicle
  - After adding a fueling, dashboard recent activity reflects the new entry

  <what-built>Phase 2 and Phase 5 verification checklists ready for execution</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start the app (`npm run dev`) and sign in.
2. Phase 2 (Vehicles):
   - Visit `/vehicles` and create a basic vehicle (brand, model, year, registration).
   - Create a second vehicle with technical data (engine capacity, power, fuel type).
   - Confirm list shows both with fuel type indicators and clickable cards.
   - Open each detail page and verify technical card appears only for the technical vehicle.
   - Edit one vehicle, save, and confirm the update on list + detail.
   - Delete one vehicle via confirmation modal and confirm it disappears.
3. Phase 5 (Dashboard):
   - Visit `/` and confirm vehicle summary cards show totals and last fueling.
   - Confirm recent activity list shows latest fuelings or the empty state when none.
   - Use a "Quick Add" button to open the fueling form for a vehicle and add a fueling.
   - Return to dashboard and confirm the new fueling appears in recent activity.
4. Record results and notes directly in the two verification files.

Update both verification files with the human-provided results:
- Mark each requirement as Pass/Fail
- Add concrete notes for any failures or deviations
- Include test data details (vehicles, fuelings) and environment (local/dev)
  </action>
  <verify>Verification files reflect actual results and notes from the checkpoint</verify>
  <done>Phase 2 and Phase 5 verification artifacts are complete and auditable.</done>

<verification>
- Both verification artifacts include requirement tables, step checklists, and recorded outcomes.

<success_criteria>

- `.planning/phases/08-stats-window-and-dod-verification-closure/08-VEHICLE-VERIFICATION.md` documents VEHI-01..06 verification.
- `.planning/phases/08-stats-window-and-dod-verification-closure/08-DASHBOARD-VERIFICATION.md` documents UIUX-02 verification.
  </success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/08-stats-window-and-dod-verification-closure/08-02-SUMMARY.md`.
