  <how-to-verify>
1. Start the app (`npm run dev`) and sign in.
2. Vehicles (Phase 2):
   - Visit `/vehicles` and create a basic vehicle (brand, model, year, registration).
   - Create a second vehicle with technical data (engine capacity, power, fuel type).
   - Confirm the list shows both vehicles with fuel type indicators and clickable cards.
   - Open each detail page and verify the technical card appears only for the technical vehicle.
   - Edit one vehicle, save, and confirm updated values in list and detail view.
   - Delete one vehicle via the confirmation modal and confirm it disappears.
   - If you delete the last vehicle, confirm the empty state appears.
3. Dashboard (Phase 5):
   - Visit `/` and confirm summary cards render totals and last fueling date.
   - Use a "Quick Add" button to add two fuelings (one can be partial).
   - Return to dashboard and confirm total distance is now non-zero.
   - Confirm recent activity shows the new fueling entry.
4. Capture any failures or unexpected behavior.

Update both verification files with the new run:
- Update the Test Session date, environment, tester, and data setup notes.
- Mark each requirement and checklist item as Pass or Fail.
- Record concrete notes for any failures or deviations.
- Fill in test data details (vehicle attributes, fuelings added).

<success_criteria>

- `.planning/phases/08-stats-window-and-dod-verification-closure/08-VEHICLE-VERIFICATION.md` records VEHI-01..VEHI-06 outcomes.
- `.planning/phases/08-stats-window-and-dod-verification-closure/08-DASHBOARD-VERIFICATION.md` records UIUX-02 outcomes, including summary totals and recent activity checks.
  </success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/08-stats-window-and-dod-verification-closure/08-04-SUMMARY.md`.
