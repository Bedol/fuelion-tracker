<objective>
Harden vehicle and statistics API routes with strict auth and ownership enforcement.

Purpose: Close cross-user read/write gaps in vehicle resources while preserving locked response semantics.
Output: Refactored vehicle list/detail/statistics endpoints using shared guardrail helpers.
</objective>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Refactor vehicle list/create endpoint to enforce session ownership</name>
  <files>pages/api/vehicles/index.ts</files>
  <action>
Refactor `pages/api/vehicles/index.ts` to use the shared auth/error helpers and enforce owner scoping for both methods:
- Require session for `GET` and `POST`; unauthenticated always returns shared `401` envelope
- `GET`: return only vehicles where `user_id = session user id` (silent filtering policy)
- `POST`: never trust client `user_id`; derive owner from session and explicitly map allowed fields
- Preserve existing switch-based method routing and 405 handling

Reject malformed payloads with existing 400 behavior where applicable, but keep 401/403 guardrail responses standardized through shared envelope helpers.
</action>
<verify>Authenticated `GET /api/vehicles` returns only caller-owned vehicles; unauthenticated `GET`/`POST` return 401 envelope; POST body `user_id` spoof attempts do not override session ownership.</verify>
<done>Vehicle list/create can no longer leak or create cross-user records.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Refactor vehicle detail endpoint with owner checks for GET/PUT/DELETE</name>
  <files>pages/api/vehicles/[id].ts</files>
  <action>
Refactor `pages/api/vehicles/[id].ts` to enforce auth + ownership in every method branch:
- Parse and validate `id` safely (400 on invalid id)
- Require session first
- `GET`: if vehicle not owned, return `403` with generic not-found wording via shared `NOT_FOUND` envelope
- `PUT`/`DELETE`: if vehicle not owned, return `403` with shared `FORBIDDEN` envelope
- Keep ownership guard checks before first write query to enforce strict no-op on failed ownership checks

Maintain explicit field mapping in updates and keep method switch + allow header conventions.
</action>
<verify>For a foreign vehicle id: GET returns `403 + NOT_FOUND` envelope, PUT/DELETE return `403 + FORBIDDEN` envelope, and DB row is unchanged after forbidden writes.</verify>
<done>Vehicle detail/update/delete are fully owner-guarded with locked response semantics and no cross-user mutation path.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Align statistics endpoint to the same owner-guarded GET-by-id policy</name>
  <files>pages/api/vehicles/[id]/statistics.ts</files>
  <action>
Update `pages/api/vehicles/[id]/statistics.ts` to match the exact guard behavior used by vehicle GET-by-id:
- Require session via shared auth helper
- Verify vehicle ownership before loading fueling rows
- On non-owner vehicle id, return `403` with generic not-found wording using shared `NOT_FOUND` envelope
- Keep existing successful statistics shape and year validation behavior

Do not change aggregation math in this phase; only harden access boundaries and response contract consistency.
</action>
<verify>Owner request returns 200 statistics payload; non-owner request returns `403 + NOT_FOUND` envelope; unauthenticated request returns 401 envelope.</verify>
<done>Statistics endpoint enforces the same ownership and error semantics as other protected GET-by-id routes.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `npm run build`
- Manual API matrix subset for vehicle/statistics endpoints (unauthenticated, owner, non-owner read, non-owner write)
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- Vehicle and statistics endpoints no longer allow cross-user access or mutation paths.
- Locked 401/403 envelope behavior is consistent across all vehicle-domain routes.
  </success_criteria>
